# Path_Optimization_in_Numerical_Control-Python

Author: Yanpeng Mei

Python environment: PyCharm

Started on: 28. Jan. 2022(will be done in 1.5 months)

These programs are about my thesis "Path optimization when interpolating in Numerical Controls"

This program was previously done in Matlab, but now I will write it again in Python out of interest. Please see my Matlab version for more information.
