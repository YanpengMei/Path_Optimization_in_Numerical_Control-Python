These programs are about my thesis "Path optimization when interpolating in Numerical Controls"

This program was originally done in Matlab, but now I will rewrite part of it in Python out of interest. Please see my Matlab version for more information.

In Matlab version, i minimized the curvature of the tool path. This time i tried something new. I minimized the length of the path.

Please read 'A1_main.py' first
